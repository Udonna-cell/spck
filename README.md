## Types of Arguments
There are two types of arguments: named and flagged.

- Named Argument
> The named argument is an argument that does not require any input.

```bash
spck [argument]
```
- Flagged Argument
> The flagged argument is an argument that accepts user input.

```bash
spck --[argument name]=[user input]
```
## Available Arguments
spck [argument]

The `spck` CLI offers a variety of available arguments that allow you to execute specific tasks, such as retrieving updates from the spck editor and sending updates to the spck editor.

The following arguments are available:
### pull (to retrieve updates)
Use the `pull` command to fetch updates from the spck editor to the spck CLI repository, facilitating further CLI excursion processes.

**When utilizing the `name` argument to pull updates, the operation will retrieve updates from the parent project folder in relation to the spck CLI repository folder.**

```bash
spck pull
```

**The `pull` command with the `flagged` argument retrieves updates based on the specified name or dot (using `.`), indicating that you intend to update the parent folder relative to your current location.**


```bash
# Pulls a specific path in the parent folder
spck --pull=todo-app

# Or pull the parent of the current folder
spck --pull=.
```
### push (to send update)
The "push" command in spck has two types of arguments: named and flagged. It is used to send updates to the spck editor.

- The "PUSH named" command sends updates from the project's root directory to the spck editor using the command `spck push`. For instance, if you're in the "app" repository within the spck repo, running the command will send updates for the entire "app" project to the spck editor.

- The "push flagged" command allows pushing updates for a specific repository directory specified by the user input. For example, using the command `spck --push=src` will only send updates for the "src" folder present in the working directory.

This facilitates targeted updates to the spck editor based on project needs.
